# Guard Panel

Guard was a licensing system I wrote late highschool, early college to help manage subscriptions for my online gaming community. This project is the source code for the windows management panel exercising the Guard client library which can be found [here](https://github.com/neetjn/ng-guard-library). It was created using .NET 4.0, and was of course designed specifically for Windows host machines.

This is an attrocity I wrote before having proper programming etiquette, don't worry I cringed while reading this as well.

Enjoy.
